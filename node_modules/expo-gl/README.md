# Installation in managed Expo projects

For managed [managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Install expo-gl-cpp

expo-gl requires that you also install and configure [expo-gl-cpp](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-gl-cpp).

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
expo install expo-gl
```

### Compatibility

To use `expo-gl` with React Native 0.58.0 or newer you will need to use `5.x.x` version of `expo-gl` and at least `0.4.0` of `react-native-unimodules`. Here is the table showing compatibility between these three packages:

| expo-gl | react-native-unimodules | react-native |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| <=4.x.x | 0.3.x                   | <=0.57.x     |
| >=5.0.0 | >=0.4.0                 | *            |

### Configure for iOS

Run `pod install` in the ios directory after installing the npm package.

### Configure for Android

No additional set up necessary.
